## Release Management

This repository uses [GitHub’s recommended release management for
actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions#using-release-management-for-actions):

- GitHub releases with tags are used for updates on the actions.
- Semantic versioning is used, with major, minor and possibly patch
  release.
- Major versions (such as `v1`) will always point to the last minor or
  patch release for this major version. (when `v1.0.2` is out, `v1` will
  point to this update to). This means using
  `viash-io/viash-actions/setup@v1` in your workflow file will
  automatically get the updated versions. Using
  `viash-io/viash-actions/setup@v1.0.2` will pin a specific release.
- Major version changes (`v1` to `v2`) will often come with breaking
  changes, and workflows might require manual updates.
