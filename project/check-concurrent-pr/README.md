Assuming that an action is triggered by both a push event and a pull
request, this action will:

- Return ‘true’ if the branch is the default branch
- Return ‘true’ if the event is not a push event
- Return ‘true’ if the commit message contains ‘ci force’
- Return ‘false’ if a PR exists for the branch, else ‘true’

### Inputs

- `github_token`: - *required*. The GitHub token to use for the GitHub
  CLI.

### Outputs

- `run`: Returns “true” if the branch has a PR and this run was not
  triggered by a push event, else “false”.
